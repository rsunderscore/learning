# learning
This is where I will keep all the files that are created as part of education work.  In many cases I have augmented to the examples provided in the educational material: streamlining code, adding additional examples, or extending the concepts. Much of this work is based on educational courses from safari or pluralsight.  I participated in an AIML learning cohort on machine learning models with scikit-learn; but once that was done I assigned myself some courses on Neural Networks so I could learn those concepts as well.
